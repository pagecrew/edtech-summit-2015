                	<h4>Bio</h4>
	                    Lisa is currently pursuing a joint MBA and Masters in Education at Stanford University. Previously, she worked at Google for a number of years in roles including marketing, strategy and operations and product management, working on products including AdWords, Zagat and Google[X]. Her last role was serving as the head of education partnerships for Google Hangouts, working closely with partners like NASA, the White House and Coursera to create virtual learning opportunities over video livestream. From that experience, Lisa became deeply passionate about leveraging technology to build high quality and accessible education for all. This will be Lisa's first time in South Africa and she is beyond excited to experience the culture, learn about the education system and connect with the rock star teachers doing the very difficult work in South Africa.

            			<p>
            			I am very passionate about educational equity and hope that technology can play a role in making learning more accessible, personalized and affordable. I believe it will be the people with a true understanding of the interactions between business, technology and pedagogy who will be best equipped to usher in the era of equal opportunity education. EdTech Summit Africa will be a unique opportunity to share my experience, but more importantly, learn from those who are doing the real work on the ground.</p>
