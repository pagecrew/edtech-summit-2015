                    <h4>Bio</h4>
                         Wendy Cross has been working in the field of international development and non-profit management for the past ten years, with a special affinity for Africa and education programs. Wendy is joining the 2015 EdTech Summit Africa team as a co-producer and is excited to be part of the expansion of EdTech Summit Africa beyond South Africa. In 2014, Wendy participated in EdTech Summit South Africa as a member of the Global Presenting Team and has supported EdTech since its pilot year through her work with Teach With Africa. Since 2011, Wendy served as the Director of Programs and Operations for the San Francisco-based organization, Teach With Africa. In this role, she managed TWA’s Educator Exchange Programs between the USA and South Africa and helped develop teacher training programs under the Global Teachers Institute framework. At TWA, Wendy also drew on her development background to support TWA’s fundraising, events, and communications. Wendy began her career in international development in 2006 with NextAid, a Los Angeles-based NGO working in Africa to develop and fund sustainable development projects benefiting vulnerable children and women, during which she spent two years living in South Africa to oversee projects in SA and Kenya. She continued her NGO work as a Grant Writer for The Global Fund for Children in Washington DC. Wendy received a master’s in Sustainable Development with a concentration in Community Development Management from SIT Graduate Institute and holds a bachelor’s degree in Film and Television Production from Chapman University.

                        <p>
                        In high school, I was most inspired in learning by projects that integrated technology in a creative way. Because of a handful of passionate teachers at my public school, I was drawn to an early career in filmmaking which later influenced my path to education and community development work in South Africa and the U.S. I love how technology enables connection in this global community that we are forming.</p>
