                    <h4>Bio</h4>
                         A filmmaker, music engineer/producer and K-12 teacher from San Francisco, Karen, also known as K2, is currently a proud New Yorker very involved in the edtech, entrepreneurship and maker/tinker world. She is passionate about education equity and social justice. She works to help schools and organizations create a culture receptive to the integration of technology as an important teaching and learning tool, an artistic and creative voice mechanism, and as a conduit for powerful communication and collaboration. She believes innovative technology strategies can make education come alive in even the most distressed of situations, especially in the ever-growing robust mobile landscape for both informal and formal learning. K2 is committed to building bridges in education for at-risk youth and teachers in challenged communities around the world. For the last 6 years most of her work has taken place in sub-Saharan Africa and in particular, South Africa as the founder and producer of EdTech Summit Africa, and as a teaching Fellow with the LEAP Schools and Teach With Africa. She has traveled the world as a sound engineer with jazz, rock and hip hop bands, falling in love with learning through interaction with other cultures. Her undergrad degree is in Broadcast Journalism and she just completed her masters in Instructional Technology and Media at Teachers College, Columbia University. Her doctoral studies will be in the Organization and Leadership department at Teachers College, focused on Adult Learning and Leadership where she will start in the fall of 2015.
