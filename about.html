                        <p><em>Creative technology strategies for meaningful teaching and learning.</em> The third annual EdTech Summit Africa tour will take place between 8 and 24 August 2015. As
                          always Summit organisers will provide free and high quality professional development in conference format, this year to thousands of teachers across six provinces, working in underserved schools in Johannesburg, Jane Furse, Nelspruit, Justica Village, Durban, East London, and Cape Town. EdTech Summit Africa will also travel to Swaziland and possibly one additional African country on the 2015 Summit tour.</p>

                          <p>EdTech Summit Africa 2015 will build on the success of the 2013 and 2014 Summits, which saw over 1,000 educators attend and begin to adopt technology into their classrooms. The EdTech Summit Team believes that motivated teachers who are exposed to new methodologies
                          combined with thoughtful training in a collaborative environment can cross generations of
                          barriers to bring excitement, innovation and measurable learning experiences into their
                          classrooms.</p>

                          <em>A technology training summit geared to improve education.</em>
                          The Summit will deliver training and development programmes in hands-on
                          workshop format to educators working in township, urban and rural schools. Many of our attendees have had limited exposure to technology and experience with devices and resources rare - but hope to bring solutions into their classrooms and schools to better serve the education needs and interests of their learners. The Summit intends to help address inequalities in education by enabling educators in under-resourced schools the opportunity to develop their own 21 st century skills, teaching methodologies and instructional strategies geared for their contexts in our conference format. These educators will then take these innovative skills, strategies and tools back into their classrooms to benefit learners in local communities.</p>

                          <p><em>An international presentation team and collaborative partnership.</em> The EdTech Summit Africa Team is a collaborative partnership between K2 Productions Global, LEAP Science and Maths Schools, the Global Teachers Institute, and Teach With Africa - organisations seeking to grow the confidence and skills of African educators with the
                          integration of technology into their teaching. An international team of education technology
                          professionals and master teachers, side by side with local African experts, will give of their time to share skills and deliver multitrack hands-on workshops geared to exposing fellow educators to technology options and open resources available in highly-funded and connected schools around the world.
